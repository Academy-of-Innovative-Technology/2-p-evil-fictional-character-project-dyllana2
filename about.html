        <p>Frieza is a tyrannical, space-faring emperor and one of Dragon Ball's most iconic villains, known for conquering planets, enslaving races (like the Saiyans, whom he nearly wiped out), and seeking ultimate power, especially immortality, through the Dragon Balls. A naturally gifted mutant, he possesses immense power without training and employs multiple transformations, clashing repeatedly with Goku and the Z Fighters, becoming a recurring threat who returns even after death, often with new forms like Black Frieza. Frieza originated from a planet called Winter, Frieza looks like purple and white alien that has a long tail.</p>
